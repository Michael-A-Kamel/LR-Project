Hello Jets Organization,

I'm writing to provide you all with an update on the progress of our analysis thusfar, in the form of an MVP. This is a key step in our process as it enables us to attempt to boil the problem down to its most basic components and examine our assumptions and project scope. Feedback from your organization is crucial here.

For this sample, we have scraped data from the Arizona Cardinals from the year 1994 to 2020. Specifically, we wanted to take a look at the play callings decisions being made, as it pertains to passing or running the ball. We examined the following metrics:

- Passing percetnage on 1st, 2nd and 3rd down  
- Average distance to 1st down on 2nd and 3rd down  
- 1st Down Conversion rates on 1st, 2nd and 3rd down  
- Passing percentage when leading, tied, and trailing (shown in the figure below)

Below is a snippit of the pair plot, showing 3 of our features (leading, tied, and trailing passing percetage).

We are excited to notice a somewhat positive correlation between passing percentage and DVOA, and we look forward to investigating all relationships further in our linear regression analysis.

Looking forward to sharing more exciting results.   

Best,   
Michael
